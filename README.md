MakerFarm
=========

MakerFarm is a C# ASP.net MVC5 web application designed to take file submissions from users and automate the tracking and assignment of prints to 3D Printers.
My initial focus is on optimising it for Makerbot 3D Printers, but I hope to extend it to support more consumer and production level printers, creating a universal management platform.

A Project related to this is RepRancher, which is a series of client side applications that communicate directly with various 3D Printers and Makerfarm, brokering information between the two.
